## Contact Manager

Contact Manager is a single page React application for demonstrating how to use React Context APIs.

### Features

- React Context API for state handling
- axios for HTTP request
- Bootstrap for components' style

### Data source

All the mock data comes from [jsonplaceholder.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)  which provides a RESTFUL API service based on [json-serve](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). Since there is no database behind the service, every `POST/PUT/DELETE` request will not be able to change the original mock data.

### Deployment

The applicaiton is deployed on [Github Pages]( https://xta0.github.io/React-Playground/).
